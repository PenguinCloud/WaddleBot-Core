# WaddleBot Configurator

The waddlebot configurator is a script that runs everytime the matterbridge container starts. It is responsible for the creation of the matterbridge.toml file that matterbridge uses to connect to all the different gateways and channels.

# Basic Setup

## 1. Python local testing

To test the API without it being in a container, do the following:

1. Ensure that you have python installed on your local machine, preferably v3.12.

2. Install the python virtual environment in the root folder of the project by typing:

`py -m venv ./venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment by running:

`venv\scripts\activate.bat`

4. Install the requirements of the script by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`
GATEWAY_SERVERS_GET_URL
