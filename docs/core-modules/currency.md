# Currency Module

The WaddleBot currency module allows a currency to be allocated to identities of individual communities. When an identity joins a community, that identity is allocated a default amount of currency and can gain currency through different means, such as by giving currency away, through giveaways, through raffles, or through duels.

## Relavent Tables

The following list of tables are related to the currency module:

| Table Name | List of Fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| currency | <ul><li>community_id</li><li>identity_id</li><li>amount</li></ul> | Stores currency values of each identity, per community |

## Modules Table Entry

As stated in the [Modules Table Entry](https://github.com/PenguinCloud/WaddleBot-Core/blob/WaddleBot-Documentation/docs/core-modules/dbm_core_modules.md#modules-table-entry) in the DBM core modules documentation, each module requires an entry in the modules table for interaction to be possible with the listener. 

The following is a JSON representation of what the currency module looks like:
