# Admin Context Module

The waddlebot admin context module allows community admins to "login" to an admin session, where they can access and execute any commands in a community that require "admin" privilages. When a context is created, a unique GUID is allocated for that user with an expiry date. If the session expires, the user needs to "login" again to make use of admin commands again.
