# Giveaway Module

The WaddleBot giveaway module allows users start giveways in specific communities that identities in the given communities can join for a prize. The winner can either be set by the person who created the giveaway, or selected randomly. Giveaways can be allocated a timeout value that will then automatically close the giveway after a certain time. 

## Relavent Tables

The following list of tables are related to the giveaway module:

| prize_statuses | <ul><li>status_name</li><li>description</li></ul> | This table keeps track of the different possible status types in the giveaway module. |

## Modules Table Entry

As stated in the [Modules Table Entry](https://github.com/PenguinCloud/WaddleBot-Core/blob/WaddleBot-Documentation/docs/core-modules/dbm_core_modules.md#modules-table-entry) in the DBM core modules documentation, each module requires an entry in the modules table for interaction to be possible with the listener. 

The following is a JSON representation of what the giveaway module looks like:
