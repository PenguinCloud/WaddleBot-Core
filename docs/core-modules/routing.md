# Routing Module

The WaddleBot routing module allows routes to be created between communities and platform channels, allowing only certain communities to be accessed by certain platforms.

## Relavent Tables

The following list of tables are related to the Routing module:

| Table Name | List of Fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| routing | <ul><li>channel</li><li>community_id</li><li>routing_gateway_ids</li><li>aliases</li></ul> | A table containing all the routing gateways that a community has access to. |

## Modules Table Entry

As stated in the [Modules Table Entry](https://github.com/PenguinCloud/WaddleBot-Core/blob/WaddleBot-Documentation/docs/core-modules/dbm_core_modules.md#modules-table-entry) in the DBM core modules documentation, each module requires an entry in the modules table for interaction to be possible with the listener. 

The following is a JSON representation of what the Routing module looks like:

```
