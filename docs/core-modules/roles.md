# Roles Module

The WaddleBot roles module allows for the allocation of roles to individual community member identities that sets their individual privilages. 

Creating a new community sets a list of default roles. These roles are created according to the default roles set in [Waddlebot's Default Roles](https://github.com/PenguinCloud/WaddleBot-Core/blob/WaddleBot-Documentation/docs/core-modules/dbm_core_modules.md#db-initialization)

## Relavent Tables

The following list of tables are related to the roles module:

| Table Name | List of Fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| roles | <ul><li>name</li><li>community_id</li><li>description</li><li>priv_list</li><li>requirements</li></ul> | Contains a list of all the roles that is available to a community. Determines module access. |

## Modules Table Entry

As stated in the [Modules Table Entry](https://github.com/PenguinCloud/WaddleBot-Core/blob/WaddleBot-Documentation/docs/core-modules/dbm_core_modules.md#modules-table-entry) in the DBM core modules documentation, each module requires an entry in the modules table for interaction to be possible with the listener. 

The following is a JSON representation of what the Roles module looks like, which is found in the Community core module entry:
