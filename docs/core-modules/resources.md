# Introductions

Our resource manager is what connects to the "sources". 
Example resource - Twitch Channel or Discord Channel

We heavily use Linux networking terms as our team and founder are heavily into the Linux realm.

# Terminology

- Resource: Any place which data is streamed from, such as a text channel
- Platform: Resource's platform type/name, such as Twitch or Discord
- Interface: The server or instance of the platform for the resource
- SubInterface: The channel or stream itself
- Routes: Definitions of what data to send from one resource to another 
- Community Namespaces: Similiar to linux namespaces, restricts data to confine element, such as a stream team or server
- Routers: similiar to router in networking, these data
- Broadcast: Resource routes which are set to mode of broadcast, which means it will send the data to all connected resources to the router


# Community Namespace

## Roles

- Administrator (2)
- Moderator (1)
- User (0)
- Custom Roles (A-Z)

## Adding Resources 

1. Resource owner adds Waddlebot to their server / channel
2. Community Administrator adds an interface to the router, such as PenguinTech's Discord Server - ```!community invite discord penguinzplays```
2. Resource owner accepts the invite - ```!community join CoolCommunity```


# Routes

You can specify what should and shouldnt be passed through. By default any resources not specified as True are assumed false.
